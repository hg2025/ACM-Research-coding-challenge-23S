I wanted to sort the stars by their temperature to see if there was any correlation with their type. So, I picked 12 random stars and made a new csv file with the types 0, 1, and 2. The program almost works, but it has the general idea. It shows that the higher the temperature, the more the star is that certain type in its life cycle.
